# Lorenzo de'Medici

This is a static (front-end) history website about Lorenzo de'Medici, the de facto ruler of Florence between 1469-1492. It is designed to be a creative and informative way for users to gain an understanding of who this person was and his achievements during his lifetime. It provides the user with a general overview of Lorenzo de'Medici, including some key dates in the form of a timeline. It moves on to describe some aspects of his patronage of artists, focusing upon three that were influenced by Lorenzo de'Medici. The responsive nature of the site means that it is easy to access and view on all media devices. The inclusion of seperate pages was to provide the user with the ability to explore more about Lorenzo de'Medici without having all the information presented at once.
