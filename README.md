It is designed to be a creative and informative way for users to gain an understanding of who this person was and his achievements during his lifetime. It provides the user with a general overview of Lorenzo de'Medici, including some key dates in the form of a timeline. It moves on to describe some aspects of his patronage of artists, focusing upon three that were influenced by Lorenzo de'Medici. The responsive nature of the site means that it is easy to access and view on all media devices.
