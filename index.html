          <ul>
            <li>
              Lorenzo de'Medici was born in Florence. His father and
              grandfather, Piero and Cosimo de'Medici respectively, were de
              facto rulers of the Florentine Republic. As such, it was intended
              that Lorenzo would become the ruler after the death of Piero.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lorenzo was educated by some of the great thinkers of the
              Renaissance, such as Gentile de'Becchi and Marsilio Ficino.
              Moreover, Piero would send him on diplomatic missions to meet
              religious and political figures.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1469, Lorenzo married Clarice Orsini and throughout their
              marriage, they had 10 children, one (Giovanni de'Medici) would
              become Pope Leo X.
            </li>
            <li>
              At the age of 20, Lorenzo's father died of gout and he became the
              de facto ruler of Florence. However, some families, such as the
              Pazzi believed that Lorenzo was too young and inexperienced to
              rule Florence.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="leader">
          <h3 class="life">Leader</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Lorenzo intended to rule in a similar manner to his grandfather,
              Cosimo de'Medici, using constitutional methods. However, Francesco
              Guicciardini defined his regime as
              <i>"that of a benevolent tyrant in a constitutional republic."</i>
            </li>
            <li>
              Lorenzo spent a large amount of his time trying to instill a peace
              along the peninsula of Italy. He was an advocate of the Treaty of
              Lodi (1454) which provided a political alliance between the Duchy
              of Milan, the Republic of Venice and the Republic of Florence.
            </li>
            <li>
              As a result of the political alliances between the Northern states
              in Italy, Pope Sixtus IV became increasingly concerned about the
              power that Lorenzo was gaining. In order to diminish his power, he
              apponted his nephew to work with the Pazzi family. Girolamo Riario
              and Francesco de'Pazzi conspired to assassinate Lorenzo and his
              brother, Giuliano, in the catherdral at the Easter mass. Giuliano
              was murdered on the 26th April 1478 and Lorenzo was wounded while
              he was escaping.
            </li>
            <li>
              As a result of the failed assassination attempt, troubles between
              Florence and the Papacy increased and led to the continued war
              between Venice, Florence and Milan against the Papacy and Naples.
              Moreover, this strenghtened the Medici families power basis, which
              would ultimately lead to the Medici family becoming Dukes of
              Florence.
