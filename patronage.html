            <p class="patron">
              Verrochio was commissioned by the Medici family for a number of
              artistic works and sculptures. Moreover, he often taught young,
              upcoming artists and sculptors, most notably Da Vinci, Ghirlandaio
              and Botticelli, all of whom had a profound influence upon the
              Renaissance artistic movement and who would themselves go on to
              receive commissions from the Medici family.

              Verrochio was commissioned by the Medici family to sculpt a bronze
              statue of David. It was purchased by the signoria in 1476.

              There are various connections between Botticelli and Lorenzo
              de'Medici. Although, it was previously believed that Lorenzo was a
              patron of Botticelli and commissioned various works of his, it is
              now widely accepted that Lorenzo's patronage of the artist was a
              recommendation to other wealthy patricians to commission his work.
              Nonetheless, Botticelli was a close friend of the Medici, and
              often incorporated them into his art.

              The adoration of the Magi painted around 1475 was commissioned by
              Gaspare di Zanobi, features many members of the Medici family,
              including Cosimo (the elder), Piero (Lorenzo's father) and Lorenzo
              de'Medici himself.

            <p class="patron">
              Michelangelo has become synonymous with the Renaissance and went
              on to become a leading artist during the time, painting some of
              the most famous works of art, such as the Sistine Chapel in the
              Vatican. From 1490-1492, Michelangelo attended the Platonic
              Academy, a humanist academy founded by the Medici. He was
              commissioned by Lorenzo to sculpt the Battle of the Centaurs
              (1491-1492).
            </p>
            <p class="patron">
              Michelangelo is best known for his completion of the Sistine
              Chapel ceiling, in which he depicts various Biblical scenes.
              Michelangelo's sculptures are considered some of his greatest
              masterpieces, where he manages to capture movement of the human
              from.
